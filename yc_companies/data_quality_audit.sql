-- Fix: Update incorrectly marked 'completed' records
-- ============================================================
-- Records marked as 'completed' should have:
-- - founder_names (not NULL, not empty, not 'Team')
-- - founder_emails (not NULL, not empty, not 'hello@...')
-- - website (not NULL, not empty)
--
-- If they're missing these, they should be 'needs_review' or 'pending'
